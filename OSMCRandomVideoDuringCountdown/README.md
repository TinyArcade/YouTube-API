# Random YouTube Channel Videos For Stream Countdown

This code will query 50 random videos (in no order) from your channel using YouTube's API, will display the duration of the video that was picked from the array store (in milliseconds on the console), will display the chosen video on the DOM using div id=player, and will then refresh the page and repeat.

Make sure to update API_KEY and CHANNEL_KEY with your own ChannelID and API KEY
